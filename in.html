<h2 style="color: white;">  DIET CHART:</h2>
<p>A diet chart is basically a guideline of what you should/should not eat. A wide range of disorders in the body can originate from making the wrong choices with respect to food. Lifestyle disorders like diabetes and obesity are prime examples what eating the wrong type of food can do.

  In order to prevent such disorders or simply bring your weight to optimal levels, you can visit a dietitian who can design a diet chart for you.<br>It will include the type of foods that you should eat and in what quantity. The scheduling of your meals is another aspect that can easily be overlooked, so a diet chart also addresses this aspect.<br> It is generally designed based on the disorder/condition that you may have. Based on a thorough examination of your medical records, the dietician will make a diet chart accordingly.</p>
